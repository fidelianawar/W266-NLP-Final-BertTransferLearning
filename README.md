Transfer Learning with Question Answering Datasets

Team: Cynthia Zhu, Fidelia Nawar, Ryan Goding

This Github repository contains our research on transfer learning with question answering datasets. 

While pre-trained models such as BERT have shown great gains across natural language understanding tasks, whether their performance can be improved by further training the model in different domains remains unclear. In this project, we evaluated the performance of BERT models in extractive question answering tasks through multiple fine-tuning stages with different domain datasets. We obtained an F1 increase of 0.24% - 2.94% on models pre-trained on different datasets compared to models without pre-training. 

About this Github: 
1. Model evaluation example notebook outlines the fine tuning and evaluation process. 
2. Each data folder contains scripts for preprocessing
