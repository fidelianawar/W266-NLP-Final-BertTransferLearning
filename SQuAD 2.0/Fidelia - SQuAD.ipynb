Thereafter, during the last 18 years of his life, he gave only some 30 public performances, preferring the more intimate atmosphere of the salon. He supported himself by selling his compositions and teaching piano, for which he was in high demand. Chopin formed a friendship with Franz Liszt and was admired by many of his musical contemporaries, including Robert Schumann. In 1835 he obtained French citizenship. After a failed engagement to Maria Wodzińska, from 1837 to 1847 he maintained an often troubled relationship with the French writer George Sand. A brief and unhappy visit to Majorca with Sand in 1838–39 was one of his most productive periods of composition. In his last years, he was financially supported by his admirer Jane Stirling, who also arranged for him to visit Scotland in 1848. Through most of his life, Chopin suffered from poor health.

Most are for solo piano, though he also wrote two piano concertos, a few chamber pieces, and some songs to Polish lyrics.

His major piano works also include mazurkas, waltzes, nocturnes, polonaises, études, impromptus, scherzos, preludes and sonatas, some published only after his death. Influences on his compositional style include Polish folk music, the classical tradition of J. S. Bach, Mozart and Schubert, the music of all of whom he admired, as well as the Paris salons where he was a frequent guest.

Chopin went on to Leipzig, where he presented Schumann with his G minor Ballade.

Liszt was the dedicatee of Chopin\\'s Op. 10 Études, and his performance of them prompted the composer to write to Hiller, \"I should like to rob him of the way he plays my studies.\" However, Chopin expressed annoyance in 1843 when Liszt performed one of his nocturnes with the addition of numerous intricate embellishments, at which Chopin remarked that he should play the music as written or not play it at all, forcing an apology. Most biographers of Chopin state that after this the two had little to do with each other, although in his letters dated as late as 1848 he still referred to him as \"my friend Liszt\". Some commentators point to events in the two men\\'s romantic lives which led to a rift between them; there are claims that Liszt had displayed jealousy of his mistress Marie d\\'Agoult\\'s obsession with Chopin, while others believe that Chopin had become concerned about Liszt\\'s growing relationship with George Sand.'}, {'qas': [{'question': 'Who was the host of the gathering where Frédéric was introduced to George Sand?', 'id': '56cc06496d243a140015ee5a', 'answers': [{'text': \"Marie d'Agoult\", 'answer_start': 30}], 'is_impossible': False}, {'question': \"What did Frédéric label the place in which he placed Maria and her mother's letters about the unlikely marriage?\", 'id': '56cc06496d243a140015ee5d', 'answers': [{'text': 'My tragedy', 'answer_start': 713}], 'is_impossible': False}, {'question': 'Who did George Sand write to when admitting having a strong affection for Frédéric?', 'id': '56cc06496d243a140015ee5e', 'answers': [{'text': 'Grzymała', 'answer_start': 747}], 'is_impossible': False}, {'question': \"What is the name of the author Chopin met at a gathering put on by Marie d'Agoult?\", 'id': '56cfdc7f234ae51400d9bf8b', 'answers': [{'text': 'George Sand', 'answer_start': 75}], 'is_impossible': False}, {'question': \"What was a possible reason for Chopin's failed engagement to Maria Wodzińska?\", 'id': '56cfdc7f234ae51400d9bf8e', 'answers': [{'text': 'his poor health', 'answer_start': 503}], 'is_impossible': False}, {'question': 'What did Chopin write on the box of letters from Maria and her mother?', 'id': '56cfdc7f234ae51400d9bf8f', 'answers': [{'text': 'My tragedy', 'answer_start': 713}], 'is_impossible': False}, {'question': 'Who hosted the party whre Chopin met George Sand?', 'id': '56d3234159d6e41400146288', 'answers': [{'text': \"Marie d'Agoult\", 'answer_start': 30}], 'is_impossible': False}, {'question': \"What year did Maria Wodzińska's mother tell Chopin that he likely would not marry her daughter?\", 'id': '56d3234159d6e41400146289', 'answers': [{'text': '1837', 'answer_start': 327}], 'is_impossible': False}, {'question': 'What did Chopin write on the package that contained letters from Maria and her mother?', 'id': '56d3234159d6e4140014628b', 'answers': [{'text': 'My tragedy', 'answer_start': 713}], 'is_impossible': False}, {'question': 'Who did Sand confide to in a letter about her feelings for Chopin in June, 1838?', 'id': '56d3234159d6e4140014628c', 'answers': [{'text': 'Grzymała', 'answer_start': 747}], 'is_impossible': False}], 'context': 'In 1836, at a party hosted by Marie d\\'Agoult, Chopin met the French author George Sand (born [Amantine] Aurore [Lucile] Dupin).

Arithmetic coding is a more modern coding technique that uses the mathematical calculations of a finite-state machine to produce a string of encoded bits from a series of input data symbols. It can achieve superior compression to other techniques such as the better-known Huffman algorithm. It uses an internal memory state to avoid the need to perform a one-to-one mapping of individual input symbols to distinct representations that use an integer number of bits, and it clears out the internal memory only after encoding the entire string of data symbols. Arithmetic coding applies especially well to adaptive data compression tasks where the statistics vary and are context-dependent, as it can be easily coupled with an adaptive model of the probability distribution of the input data. An early example of the use of arithmetic coding was its use as an optional (but not widely used) feature of the JPEG image coding standard.

This building was constructed in the early 19th century by General Bhimsen Thapa. It is the most important museum in the country, housing an extensive collection of weapons, art and antiquities of historic and cultural importance. The museum was established in 1928 as a collection house of war trophies and weapons, and the initial name of this museum was Chhauni Silkhana, meaning \"the stone house of arms and ammunition\". Given its focus, the museum contains many weapons, including locally made firearms used in wars, leather cannons from the 18th–19th century, and medieval and modern works in wood, bronze, stone and paintings.\n",

In addition to social and economic equality in hunter-gatherer societies, there is often, though not always, sexual parity as well. Hunter-gatherers are often grouped together based on kinship and band (or tribe) membership. Postmarital residence among hunter-gatherers tends to be matrilocal, at least initially. Young mothers can enjoy childcare support from their own mothers, who continue living nearby in the same camp. The systems of kinship and descent among human hunter-gatherers were relatively flexible, although there is evidence that early human kinship in general tended to be matrilineal.\n",

Such forces act perpendicular to the velocity vector associated with the motion of an object, and therefore do not change the speed of the object (magnitude of the velocity), but only the direction of the velocity vector. The unbalanced force that accelerates an object can be resolved into a component that is perpendicular to the path, and one that is tangential to the path. This yields both the tangential force, which accelerates the object by either slowing it down or speeding it up, and the radial (centripetal) force, which changes its direction.\n",
